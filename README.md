# Capmo Code Review Challenge
This is a basic Pull Request to form part of our Code Review Challenge. This serves as a template for analysing both effectiveness as a reviewer in day-to-day work, as well as the depth of the comments provided.

## How to use Code Review in your hiring process
The goal isnâ€™t just to test if a candidate has reviewed code in the past. Instead, by analyzing the depth of comments, you can get a better signal on exactly how senior they are.

A more junior candidate, for example, might only call out syntax, spacing, or naming. A senior candidate, on the other hand, might raise more probing questions about long-term readability, maintainability, security concerns, and scalability.

## How to use this template
In order to make use of this template, please follow the below steps:

* Create a branch off the `pr-review-challenge` branch with the following naming `capmo-<candidate-name>-<date>`
* Create a pull request from the newly created branch into `main`

## Follow up questions
* What would you do to improve the code, what would you do differently?
