# Capmo Code Review Challenge

Hey ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the code review challenge!

In this repo, you'll find an open pull-request, â€” that's what we're going to be talking about during the interview.

The author of this pull-request (your interviewer) is proposing some changes in the code, and you are the reviewer. Your role in this situation is to work with the author of the changes to collectively make those changes better.

This is hypothetical situation. However, it does include some technologies that we use at Capmo on a daily basis. But don't worry if you see something unfamiliar, â€” feel free to ask questions during the live code review and have a conversation with the author of the changes.

---

The live code review challenge is part of the technical interview with Capmo. This typically takes about 25â€“30 minutes, so feel free to study the pull-request a bit in advance to keep the live conversation more focused.

Thanks and talk soon!
